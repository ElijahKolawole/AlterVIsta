<a href="http://www.uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a>, 
<a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, <b>RocketsRUs Corp</b>
is pioneering the first in a new generation of space craft, the Pegasus space plane. 
Pegasus takes off like an airplane, from a concentional runway. Once above 30,000 feet, the ship lights its scramjet (&copy; RocketsRUs Corp) which
boasts the ship an additional 100,000 feet above the atmosphere. At this point, a small rocket is used to take the ship up the remaining 100
miles to reach low Earth orbit.
